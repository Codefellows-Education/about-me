                    Hi there - I'm Lena. Currently learning everything I can about coding at Code Fellows. I'm super interested in machine learning, photography, and math. Connect with me and say hi!

                        I have always loved solving puzzles. My family used jigsaw puzzles as a way of connecting during holidays. Long after everyone else had given up, I sat by the fire placing piece after piece completely oblivious to the passage of time. In college, I solved math problems in my spare time for fun and as a way to relax. Despite my aptitude for problem solving and mathematics, college counselors and advisors - even my family - pushed me in the humanitarian direction encouraging me to develop my creative skills. When I started my photography business, I indulged in taking a CSS/HTML class at the community college justifying it as a business expense to build my website. With my photography business at a crossroads, I decided to take the plunge and signed up for Code Fellows 101 and 102. Learning JavaScript was challenging and kept me awake every night as I struggled to figure out the complexities of the language, but I once again found myself in that state of flow. I thrive on challenge, and coding, with its infinite complexities, is the kind of challenge I love most.
